Andromeda 0.2.0
===============

Changes

- Dropping nrow and ncol support, as this seems to cause instability and is not consistent with dplyr.

- Dropping isSorted function, as database queries are only guaranteed to stay sorted if explicitly required to (using 'arrange').

- Added restoreDate and restorePosixct functions.

Bug fixes

- Fixed typo in isAndromeda function name.

- Fixed incompatibility issue with dplyr 1.0.0 causing 'method not supported' error.

- Correctly handling differences in column order when appending.

- Fixed copying of zero-row tables from one Andromeda to another.

- Fixed issue where Andromeda object inheritance was lost on R restart.
